        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The rich and sweet flavor of banana bread infused into a healthy baked oatmeal. 
            This Banana Bread Baked Oatmeal is perfect for breakfast meal prep!</p>
        <p> If you’re new to the world of baked oatmeal, it’s a wonderfully rich and moist breakfast treat. 
            It’s basically oats baked into a custard. Kind of like bread pudding, but with oats instead of bread. </p>
            If you think you don’t like oats because they tend to be gooey when boiled with water, try baked oatmeal. 
        <p> It’s <em>soft, moist, and rich</em>, but not at all gooey. 
            Some people also mistakenly think baked oats are crunchy, but they’re not. </p>
